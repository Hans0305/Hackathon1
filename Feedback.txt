Hello Hans this is your hACKATON feedback. In general you implement well the DOM manipulation and event listeners.
Always be aware that when you present a project it need to be working in the moment you upload it. I have to comment
some lines in your code for it to work. I liked the styling you made. I will recommend not to put any script in to your html

Also if you want to work with dates and time you can use the date library on javascrypt and call
new Date() that creates a date object with the current date and time.

Keep working and if you need help to finish this project let me know. 

COngratulations.
